# Mar. 1st, 2024
## Meeting Overview

This report summarizes the key points discussed during our recent team meeting, which was held to communicate our progress to the company and address our concerns regarding the project's direction. The meeting was productive, with positive feedback from the company regarding our initial efforts and a constructive response to our concerns.

## Team Progress

Our team provided a comprehensive update on the project's status, detailing the work completed so far and outlining the planned steps moving forward. We highlighted the dedication and effort of all team members in meeting the project's initial milestones. The company expressed **satisfaction with our start**, acknowledging the quality of work and the commitment shown by us.

## Addressing Concerns

A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing our concerns regarding the vagueness of the project topic. We expressed that the broad nature of the project aim was a challenge, potentially affecting our ability to deliver targeted and effective solutions.

## Company's Response

In response to our concerns, the company provided clearer guidance to help focus our efforts. They have **narrowed the project's aim** to specifically involve:

1. **Processing the Data**: The company will be sending us data this week. Our task is to process this data effectively to derive meaningful insights.
2. **Guidance for Truck Drivers**: Using the processed data, we are to develop solutions that inform truck drivers on how to:
   - **Earn More**: Strategies or suggestions based on data analysis that could help drivers increase their earnings.
   - **Form Better Habits**: Insights into how drivers can improve their habits based on the four modes of operation:
     - On Duty Driving
     - On Duty Not Driving
     - Off Duty Sleeping
     - Off Duty Not Sleeping

This more focused direction is expected to streamline our efforts, allowing us to apply our skills more effectively to deliver impactful results.

## Next Steps

With the new direction provided, we outlined the following steps to move forward with the project:

1. **Data Reception and Review**: Await the arrival of the data from the company and conduct an initial review to understand its structure and content.
2. **Data Processing Strategy**: Develop a strategy for processing the data, identifying key metrics and patterns that can inform our solutions.
3. **Solution Development**: Based on the insights gained from the data, create practical tools or recommendations for truck drivers to enhance their earnings and habits.
4. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Maintain open communication with the company to ensure our solutions align with their expectations and adjust our approach as needed.

## Conclusion

The meeting with the company was a pivotal moment for our team, providing us with the direction needed to focus our efforts more effectively. The company's satisfaction with our start boosts our confidence, and the clarification of the project's aim allows us to proceed with a clearer understanding of our goals. We are committed to leveraging the data provided to develop meaningful solutions that will positively impact truck drivers' earnings and habits.

In this week's meeting, we further discussed what we can do given the data and how to analyze it. Even though the manager lost the privilege to access the Schneider database, he has already requested access from his boss and will provide at least some of the schemas to us. Furthermore, he demo'ed the following:
